This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Technical Debt

- When on Landing page and already signed in, the sign in/up buttons need to properly disapear
- In the Conversation page, the entered question needs proper spacing
- In the Conversation page, avatar and text in the conversation cards need proper alignment
